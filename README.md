# End-to-End Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline Project (Arch) ![CompleteCICDProject!](https://lucid.app/publicSegments/view/0c183bd6-73f4-4547-93e1-5246db5e863c/image.png)
# Project Overview

This project showcases a **production-grade CI/CD pipeline built with Jenkins**, designed to automate the entire software delivery lifecycle—from code commit to deployment. The pipeline is capable of handling **real-world enterprise requirements** such as build automation, testing, code quality analysis, containerization, artifact management, and deployment to production-like environments.  

The repository demonstrates how DevOps engineers design and manage **complete CI/CD ecosystems** with Jenkins at the center, integrating popular tools and practices. It is ideal as a **portfolio-ready project** to highlight expertise in Jenkins and modern CI/CD workflows.

## ✨ Key Features

- **End-to-End Pipeline**: Automates build, test, containerization, and deployment.
- **Jenkins Declarative Pipelines**: Centralized `Jenkinsfile` for multi-stage delivery.
- **Static Code Analysis**: Integrates quality gates (SonarQube or similar).
- **Containerization & Artifact Management**: Docker builds and pushes to artifact registry.
- **Deployment Automation**: Deploys to servers or Kubernetes clusters.
- **Scalable & Extensible**: Easily adapted to enterprise requirements.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Jenkins** installed (local or server). Recommended plugins:
  - Pipeline, Git, Docker, Blue Ocean, SonarQube Scanner.
- **Docker** installed and configured on Jenkins agents.
- **GitHub Webhook** integrated with Jenkins job.
- **Optional**: Kubernetes cluster or cloud infra for deployment.

### Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akupheaws/Production-Grade-Complete-CICD-Pipeline-With-Jenkins
   cd Production-Grade-Complete-CICD-Pipeline-With-Jenkins
   ```

2. Open Jenkins → create a **Pipeline job** pointing to this repo.

3. Configure credentials and environment variables inside Jenkins.

4. Run the pipeline → watch build, test, and deployment stages execute.

## ⚙️ Jenkinsfile (Pipeline as Code)

The `Jenkinsfile` is the heart of the pipeline. Example stages:

```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any

  stages {
    stage('Build') {
      steps {
        sh 'npm install'
      }
    }
    stage('Test') {
      steps {
        sh 'npm test'
      }
    }
    stage('Dockerize') {
      steps {
        sh 'docker build -t myapp:${BUILD_NUMBER} .'
      }
    }
    stage('Deploy') {
      steps {
        sh './scripts/deploy.sh'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> Adjust stages for your technology stack (Node.js, Java, Python, etc.).

## 🧪 Testing

- **Unit & Integration tests** run in the pipeline before packaging.
- Test reports can be integrated into Jenkins with JUnit or HTML publishers.
- Quality gates prevent broken builds from being deployed.

---

## 🔒 Security & Best Practices

- Use Jenkins credentials store for secrets (no hardcoding in code).
- Integrate image scanning (e.g., Trivy, Anchore) in the pipeline.
- Apply role-based access control (RBAC) in Jenkins.
- Ensure Docker daemon is secured and runs with least privilege.

---

## 🛣️ Roadmap

- [ ] Add Helm charts for Kubernetes deployment.
- [ ] Add Canary/Blue-Green deployment stages.
- [ ] Integrate Slack/MS Teams notifications.
- [ ] Add automated rollback strategies.
- [ ] Multi-branch pipeline support for feature environments.
